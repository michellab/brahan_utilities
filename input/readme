bind_site.pdb and subR.pdb were created from npt.gro using vmd 
cis and ts AAPF was created from subR.pdb by using VMD's scripting interface 
to give transformation matrix  to rotate omega dihedral angle.


1. bind_site.pdb is a pdb file of residues within 5 Angstrom of substrate and residues
   This is the list of residue in bind_site.pdb
   TRP121, ARG55, GLN63, ASN102, PHE113, LEU122, MET61, PHE60, HIS126, ILE57, GLN111
   This pdb file created from npt.gro using vmd


2. subR.pdb is a pdb file of reactant substrate (trans AAPF)

3. subP.pdb is a pdb file of product substate (cis AAPF)

4. subTS.pdb is a pdb file of transition state substrate (ts AAPF)
